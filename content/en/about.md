Passionate Game programmer graduate with experience creating interactive and immersive games and prototypes. My top skills include C++, Unity, Godot, Git, and problem-solving. One of my achievements were when I was part of a 11-member team creating a game where I saw players smiling when playing. That brought me happiness and further drive. Here I also created a particle system that was optimized on the GPU using compute shaders for this game. My passion is to create optimized and immersive games with a focus on the players.

I'm currently looking for opportunities as a Game Programmer focused on Gameplay.

I went to Blekinge Institute of Technology and graduated with a bachelor in computer science with the orientation game programming. I started in 2017 and graduated 2021 which was a wonderful time of education and passion in creating video games. Meeting people that had the same interest was one of the best part in my journey at Blekinge Institute of Technology. I did many projects during this time but I show my two largest in the projects tab.

Hope this portfolio gives you an idea of my expertise and joy in creating immersive games.
